Your Smallest Requirements, Our Happiest Accomplishments
<br>

## **Introduction**

The impact of COVID-19 has been extraordinary in both the disruption and evolution of many small businesses. Numerous research sheds light on the financial fragility of these businesses due to mass layoffs, closures and lack of resources. In this **New-normal era**, we **intend to uplift and provide a credible platform for emerging small businesses/startups to showcase their product via our website.**
<br>

### 🔭 &nbsp; **About this Project**

Taking into consideration, the financial fragility of small businesses, we are on a journey to facilitate the commercialization of the same by providing a credible platform! We bring to the consumers, the feasibility of online shopping, assurance of covid protocols and exclusive daily essentials at their doorstep in a jiffy. 

Resolving the everlasting question of what's different?
We have now fetched a solution to encourage the consumers to purchase quality products in everyday life by enabling their preferred way of green-grocery shopping, i.e, via the local vegetable vendors at an affordable range. They can now track the available vegetable vendors through an **in-radius navigation system** and let them come to their place **at our own convenience**. Enhancing the quality, feasibility and cost-effectiveness, we can **get rid of the packaged, less-authentic greengroceries** through marts/other online modes.
